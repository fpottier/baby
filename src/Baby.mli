(**This library offers two flavors of binary search trees as well as
   building blocks that allow advanced users to construct their own
   custom flavors.

   For {b height-balanced binary search trees}, ready for use,
   please see {!Baby.H.Set.Make}.

   For {b weight-balanced binary search trees}, ready for use,
   please see {!Baby.W.Set.Make}.
