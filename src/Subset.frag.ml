(* This version adds a positive fast path (based on physical equality), a
   negative fast path (based on weights), and a special treatment of the case
   where [t1] is a singleton. (There is no need to add special treatment of
   the case where [t2] is a singleton. Indeed, the subcases where [t1] is
   empty or a singleton are taken care of already, and the subcase where [t1]
   has more than one element is caught by the weight test.) *)

(* In weight-balanced trees, the weight of a tree can be determined in time
   O(1). This yields a negative fast path: if [weight t1 <= weight t2] does
   not hold, then [subset t1 t2] returns false. In height-balanced trees, the
   [weight] function returns a constant value, so this fast path is
   disabled. *)
