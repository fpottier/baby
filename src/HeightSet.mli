(**This module defines a memory layout and a height-based balancing scheme for
   binary search trees. It offers an abstract API, described by the signature
   [BASE_SET]. *)

(**Because (in light of the limited optimization ability of the current OCaml
   compiler) the minimal abstract interface imposes a performance penalty, we
   also expose a concrete view of the memory layout. *)
