(* Unfortunately, the OCaml compiler is pretty bad at optimization. In my
   experience, although it does usually inline functions when requested, it
   does not subsequently perform the simplifications that one might naturally
   expect. In particular, it does not simplify match-of-match, and cannot even
   simplify match-of-constructor. *)

(* For this reason, instead of applying the functor [Make] (above), we inline
   it, using a preprocessor hack. Thus, we avoid the overhead of going through
   a [view] function; instead, we have a [VIEW] macro. *)
