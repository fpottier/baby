(**This module defines a memory layout and a weight-based balancing scheme
   for binary search trees. It is specialized to the case where the values
   carried by the tree are pairs: see the constraint ['v = 'key * 'data]
   below. It offers an abstract API, described by the signature [BASE_MAP]. *)

(**Because (in light of the limited optimization ability of the current OCaml
   compiler) the minimal abstract interface imposes a performance penalty, we
   also expose a concrete view of the memory layout. *)
