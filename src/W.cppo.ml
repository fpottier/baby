  (* Because we have access to the concrete view of sets and maps, and because
     we know that sets and maps use the same balancing scheme, we can copy the
     balancing information (that is, the field [w]). We save the cost of
     recomputing this information at each node. *)

  (* Because we use concrete data constructors (as opposed to smart
     constructor functions), we can annotate these recursive functions with
     [@tail_mod_cons], which presumably makes them faster. *)
