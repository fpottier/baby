# To Do

* Should `from_more` be renamed to `cons_enum_from`?

* Benchmark weight-balanced trees. (Vary Î±.)

* Weight balance gives us efficient
  random access and splitting by index.
  It also facilitates conversion to a sorted array.

* Make sure everything is tested, including `Enum`.

* Benchmark.

* Make sure that we have every function from BFS
  and from OCaml's `Set` API.

* If possible, hide `Signatures` from the end user.

* Implement maps without code duplication.

* Explore parallel computation.
